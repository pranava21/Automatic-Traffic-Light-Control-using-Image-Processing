# Automatic-Traffic-Light-Control-using-Image-Processing
Traffic is one of the major issues in India. The population explosion has led to extreme growth in traffic all over India, 
especially in the major cities, which leads to wastage of fuel and time, waiting at signals. Most signals have preset values for timers. 
Traffic in India being very unpredictable, and haphazard using preset timers is not the most efficient way to control traffic flow at signals.
One of the best methods to control traffic lights, is calculate the traffic density on the roads using videos captures in real time, 
and actuate the lights based on the latest traffic densities calculated using Image Processing. 
This project discusses on how to control traffic at a four-road junction, efficiently. 
In India, most cities do not have dedicated lanes for ambulances use, owing to high traffic everywhere. 
If an ambulance is stuck at a signal waiting for eternity, can cause loss of life. Detecting presence of ambulance on roads at signals has become ever more imperative.
RF modules is the answer, to detect the presence of an ambulance at the earliest and make sure it is on its way. 
Closed Circuit Cameras are used to capture the videos at the junction
